**Hello, I'm Gian**  
a Senior Frontend Engineer from Italy 🇮🇹  
I currently work at [at-point](https://atpoint.ch/) mainly in React ⚛️  
Previously, I worked at [Fatture in Cloud.it](https://www.fattureincloud.it)


I love how computer science can digitize, speed up and automate work operations on everyday life.  
I truly believe in Arthur C. Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".  
I also love well-made designs, travelling, Hackathons, good food and whiskey.
