**Hello, I'm Gian**  
a Full Stack Developer from Italy 🇮🇹  
I currently work at [Fatture in Cloud.it](https://www.fattureincloud.it) mainly in React ⚛️

I love how computer science can digitize, speed up and automate work operations on everyday life.  
I truly believe in Arthur C. Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".  
I also love well-made designs, travelling, Hackathons, good food and whiskey.
