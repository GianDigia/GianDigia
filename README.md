### Hello, I'm Gian!

I'm a FullStack Developer working mainly with JavaScript from Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ 

I currently work at [Fatture in Cloud.it](https://www.fattureincloud.it)

I love how computer science can digitize, speed up and automate work operations on everyday life.

I truly believe in Arthur C. Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".

I also love well-made designs, travelling, Hackathons, good food and whiskey.
